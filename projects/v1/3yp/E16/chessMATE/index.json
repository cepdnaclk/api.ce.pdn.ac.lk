    "description": "The project \u201cchessMATE\u201d provides the grand usual chess board experience through an online platform. Chess is one of the most popular and oldest board games and most chess players are more likely to play chess on a physical chessboard rather than on a mobile or desktop screen. Project chessMATE resolves the main issues faced by the online chess players by providing an electronically powered chessboard and mobile app so that distant players can connect and play on actual chessboards. Game live streaming option and chess tutorials are included in the mobile app. Board vs board, app vs board and app vs app are the available game modes in chessMATE.",
