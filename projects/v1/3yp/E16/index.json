In most of our day-to-day life, we have experienced that air conditioners, projectors are working unnecessarily even without a presence of a meeting and sometimes those devices should be controlled with a human involvement using several types of remote controllers which is really an inefficient way. Our approach to that matter is automating this process introducing a control unit per each meeting room and a client application. Client application is basically used for scheduling meetings and meeting room configurations that data related to air conditioners and projectors is set. Control unit in meeting room sends required signals to turn on/off devices according to the schedules added to the system by the client application. In addition to that, mobile application can be used to control devices by scanning a QR code.",
