    "description": "In this project, we are developing a water tank monitoring system for providing clean water and reduce the water wastage. Also users will get notifications about related news like water cuts. Mainly our project focused to monitor those factors in very user friendly way. By using a simple mobile app or using a web site it can be done. This will initiate a different way of water monitoring instead of using traditional methods. ",
