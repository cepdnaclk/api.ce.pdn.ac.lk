    "description": "The idea is about to provide a comfortable and easy tracking option for a user to track a person under home quarantine due to the current pandemic situation by tracking their location. The user will be marking a geo fence when they register a new person under quarantine so the user will be notified if the fencing rules are violated. Apart from this the device will be measuring the body temperature of the person, so if he start showing symptoms(fever) of Covid 19, then the user can take necessary actions regarding the person's health.
