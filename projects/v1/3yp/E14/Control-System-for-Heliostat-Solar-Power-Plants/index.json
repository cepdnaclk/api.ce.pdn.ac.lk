    "description": "This is a system which focus sunlight into a one point in a solar tower and heat up the salts in it upto higher temperatures and then use them to store heat energy and produce steam and generate electricity. These systems make it possible to supply power even when the sun is down because of the stored heat energy. In these power plants, array of flat movable mirrors called heliostats are used to focus sunlight into a collector tower to heat salts and generate electricity through steam turbines. This is seen as  a viable solution for renewable energy.",
