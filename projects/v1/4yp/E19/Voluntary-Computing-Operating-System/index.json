    "description": "A lightweight operating system design for voluntary computing across peer-to-peer (P2P) devices connected via local network, enabling efficient resource pooling and sharing, fault tolerance, and scalability. The proposed DOS will allow devices within a local network to share excess computational resources dynamically.",
