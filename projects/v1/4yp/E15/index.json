Skim sequencing is obtaining low coverage genome sequencing data that includes, nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondria genome sequences. Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome (usually about 20-30GB data), which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. To date, there are many assembly processes/pipelines described to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. However, how much data is needed or actually used in such analysis is not clear. Having such information will help biologists to design their experiments properly and cost-effectively. Biologists expect a simple, fast and user-friendly procedure to assemble and annotate a circular chloroplast genome using Illumina NGS data.   In this project, we will research the existing procedures for chloroplast genome assembly and annotation, and work on developing the methods to identify and select the optimal set(s) of data and the procedure(s) to assemble a given chloroplast genome as accurately and efficiently as possible, by using computational, statistical & heuristical methods.

They have used several DNA based methods for phylogeny such as DNA extraction, DNA replication and DNA sequencing. Skim sequencing is the most preferred sequencing method since it results in low coverage data at a low cost.  Biologists have identified a fast-evolving region called Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) inside nuclear ribosomal DNA repeats of eukaryotic cells. They prefer to isolate this ITS region from skim sequencing data since it leads to a more accurate species variation analysis. However, because of the huge of data and unclarity on how much data is minimum needed, they find it much difficult to gather ITS regions as efficiently and as accurately as possible.  Therefore, the purpose of this project is come with a simple, efficient, accurate and user-friendly procedure to isolate ITS regions from skim sequencing data to provide a clear pathway for the biologists for phylogenetic studies to solve their problems.",

Under the data collection stage, initial data set was chosen. We used Galaxy platform for preprocessing. The statistical analysis included significance value (pValue) analysis, fold change analysis followed by the area under receiver operating curve (AUC) analysis. For the features reduced from the statistical methods, feature selection was done under three methods as PCA, Random Forest and correlation coefficient analysis. We used classification algorithms for presenting the possibilty of miRNAs in making better predictions. In this project, we used python programming language for both statistical analysis and machine learning analysis of the data.",

        "description": " Near-Infrared spectroscopy is used for better vein visualization to make the venipuncture process more efficient. It is usually a painful and time-consuming process and its difficulty increases with the dark skin tones, obesity of patients, and several other health and physical conditions.  Although near-IR spectroscopy is identified as a good solution, its usage is limited to availability, high cost, and doubts about accuracy. The cost of each of these products is very high and not affordable especially in countries like ours. We have implemented a mechanism for better accuracy and lower risk, using an illumination system that favors Asian skin types, while reducing the cost of the device so that it is more affordable especially for common clinical use in countries like ours.",

        "description": "Online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost.  This project proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, without using any external hardware or standalone application. As a result, several misconducts during the examination can be identified and labelled as suspicious.",

        "description": "This includes a novel method to measure the quality of the actions performed in Olympic weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. Human action recognition is a well-studied problem in computer vision and on the other hand action quality assessment is researched and experimented comparatively low. This is due to the lack of datasets that can be used to assess the quality of actions. In this research, we introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level. We intended to develop a viable automated scoring system through action recognition that would be beneficial in the sports industry. ",
