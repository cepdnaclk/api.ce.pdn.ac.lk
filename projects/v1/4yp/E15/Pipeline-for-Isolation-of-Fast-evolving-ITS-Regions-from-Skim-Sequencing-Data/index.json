    "title": "Pipeline for Isolation of Fast evolving ITS Regions from Skim Sequencing Data",
    "description": "Biologists have been interested in phylogenetic studies over the years. They have used several DNA based methods for phylogeny such as DNA extraction, DNA replication and DNA sequencing. Skim sequencing is the most preferred sequencing method since it results in low coverage data at a low cost.  Biologists have identified a fast-evolving region called Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) inside nuclear ribosomal DNA repeats of eukaryotic cells. They prefer to isolate this ITS region from skim sequencing data since it leads to a more accurate species variation analysis. However, because of the huge of data and unclarity on how much data is minimum needed, they find it much difficult to gather ITS regions as efficiently and as accurately as possible.  Therefore, the purpose of this project is come with a simple, efficient, accurate and user-friendly procedure to isolate ITS regions from skim sequencing data to provide a clear pathway for the biologists for phylogenetic studies to solve their problems.",
