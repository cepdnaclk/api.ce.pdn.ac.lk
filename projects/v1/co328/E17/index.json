        "description": "Floods are the most destructive form of natural hazards in both local and global context. This is true in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Early flood forecasting can be used to identify potential areas of flooding in order to develop mitigatory planning and evacuation programs to remove people from such areas during flooding and also to implement suitable preventive measures to avoid damage to properties. In this project, our main objective is to build a flood forecasting system for Mi Oya river basin(Sri Lanka). Mi Oya Basin is heavily affected by seasonal flooding and droughts. As per the available data, floods in the Mi Oya basin are unleashed due to river overflow and reservoir spilling. Out of the several reservoirs located in the basin, Tabbowa and Inginimitiya are crucial in worsening the flood impacts as these two reservoirs are frequently spilling under adverse weather conditions. As such, the prevalence of a real-time flood forecasting model with the incorporation of the reservoir operations for the entire basin is essential to alleviate the flood induced impacts while preserving the optimum volume of water in the major reservoirs in the basin.",

Even though this traditional farming system have been used for years, the system is hectic and fail to prove high productivity rate as farmer usually unable to measure all the parameter accurately. In contrast, greenhouse farming is a system where farmer cultivate crops in ecosystem environments where all environmental parameters are adjusted based on crop types. Automation in greenhouse is a method where farmer can monitor and control the greenhouse environment automatically from anywhere in the world any time. Automated greenhouse monitoring and controlling system that incorporate various sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor and light sensor to collect possible environmental parameters of greenhouse. Internet of Things (IoT) is used to store data to a database and process the collected data and finally send the information to the web interface which has been developed for monitoring and controlling of greenhouse by the user.",
