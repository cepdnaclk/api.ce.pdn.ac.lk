    "title": "Chloroplast genome, nuclear ITS regions, mitogenome regions, and Skmer analysis resolved the genetic relationship among Cinnamomum species in Sri Lanka",
    "venue": "PLOS One",

    "abstract": "Cinnamomum species have gained worldwide attention because of their economic benefits. Among them, C. verum (synonymous with C. zeylanicum Blume), commonly known as Ceylon Cinnamon or True Cinnamon is mainly produced in Sri Lanka. In addition, Sri Lanka is home to seven endemic wild cinnamon species, C. capparu-coronde, C. citriodorum, C. dubium, C. litseifolium, C. ovalifolium, C. rivulorum and C. sinharajaense. Proper identification and genetic characterization are fundamental for the conservation and commercialization of these species. While some species can be identified based on distinct morphological or chemical traits, others cannot be identified easily morphologically or chemically. The DNA barcoding using rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA regions could not also resolve the identification of Cinnamomum species in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we generated Illumina Hiseq data of about 20x coverage for each identified species and a C. verum sample (India) and assembled the chloroplast genome, nuclear ITS regions, and several mitochondrial genes, and conducted Skmer analysis. Chloroplast genomes of all eight species were assembled using a seed-based method.According to the Bayesian phylogenomic tree constructed with the complete chloroplast genomes, the C. verum (Sri Lanka) is sister to previously sequenced C. verum (NC_035236.1, KY635878.1), C. dubium and C. rivulorum. The C. verum sample from India is sister to C. litseifolium and C. ovalifolium. According to the ITS regions studied, C. verum (Sri Lanka) is sister to C. verum (NC_035236.1), C. dubium and C. rivulorum. Cinnamomum verum (India) shares an identical ITS region with C. ovalifolium, C. litseifolium, C. citriodorum, and C. capparu-coronde. According to the Skmer analysis C. verum (Sri Lanka) is sister to C. dubium and C. rivulorum, whereas C. verum (India) is sister to C. ovalifolium, and C. litseifolium. The chloroplast gene ycf1 was identified as a chloroplast barcode for the identification of Cinnamomum species. We identified an 18 bp indel region in the ycf1 gene, that could differentiate C. verum (India) and C. verum (Sri Lanka) samples tested.",
