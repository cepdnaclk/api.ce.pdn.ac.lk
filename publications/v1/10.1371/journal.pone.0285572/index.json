    "title": "Genetic features of Sri Lankan elephant, Elephas maximus maximus Linnaeus revealed by high throughput sequencing of mitogenome and ddRAD-seq",
    "venue": "PLOS One",
    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Elephas maximus maximus Linnaeus, the Sri Lankan subspecies is the largest and the darkest among Asian elephants. Patches of depigmented areas with no skin color on the ears, face, trunk, and belly morphologically differentiate it from the others. The elephant population in Sri Lanka is now limited to smaller areas and protected under Sri Lankan law. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, the relationship between Sri Lankan elephants and their phylogenetic position among Asian elephants remains controversial. While identifying genetic diversity is the key to any conservation and management strategies, limited data is currently available. To address such issues, we analyzed 24 elephants with known parental lineages with high throughput ddRAD-seq. The mitogenome suggested the coalescence time of the Sri Lankan elephant at ~0.2 million years, and sister to Myanmar elephants supporting the hypothesis of the movement of elephants in Eurasia. The ddRAD-seq approach identified 50,490 genome-wide SNPs among Sri Lankan elephants. The genetic diversity within Sri Lankan elephants assessed with identified SNPs suggests a geographical differentiation resulting in three main clusters; north-eastern, mid-latitude, and southern regions. Interestingly, though it was believed that elephants from the Sinharaja rainforest are of an isolated population, the ddRAD-based genetic analysis clustered it with the north-eastern elephants. The effect of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity could be further assessed with more samples with specific SNPs identified in the current study.",
