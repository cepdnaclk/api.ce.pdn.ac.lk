    "abstract": "Present-day mobile phones combine the capabilities of communication devices, cameras and computers. Even though their educational values are well established, their widespread use is hindered by the general fears about students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 misuse of mobile phones and other barriers such as their operating cost and teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inexperience of using them. As a solution to circumvent the barriers of using mobile phones, in this study a set of mobile phones which is connected in a private network using Wi-Fi is considered. An IT application that can be used to manage the private network was developed. A lesson was conducted outside the classroom. Both students and teachers agreed that the mobile phones in a private network supported the outside learning activity and provided a novel learning experience.",
