            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

However, advances in in situ genomics require parallel development of portable, offline solutions for the computational analysis of sequencing data. Here we introduce Genopo, a mobile toolkit for nanopore sequencing analysis. Genopo compacts popular bioinformatics tools to an Android application, enabling fully portable computation. To demonstrate its utility for in situ genome analysis, we use Genopo to determine the complete genome sequence of the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in nine patient isolates sequenced on a nanopore device, with Genopo executing this workflow in less than 30\u00e2\u0080\u0089min per sample on a range of popular smartphones. We further show how Genopo can be used to profile DNA methylation in a human genome sample, illustrating a flexible, efficient architecture that is suitable to run many popular bioinformatics tools and accommodate small or large genomes. As the first ever smartphone application for nanopore sequencing analysis, Genopo enables the genomics community to harness this cheap, ubiquitous computational resource.",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance. The paper also analyses the functionality and the performance of different components, hidden layers, and the entire pipeline.",

The existing accurate detection mechanism (pulse oximetry) is a skin contact measurement. The existing non-contact mechanisms (acoustics, video processing) are not accurate enough. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer. The paper discusses the accuracy of the algorithm on real data, advantages of the new algorithm, its limitations and suggests future improvements.",

Generating reflectance and shading from a single image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly. We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example images) showing several avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

Much work has been done in this area, yet there is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process. In the paper we have measured, compared and reported the time taken for the protein inference process in our framework against a pure software implementation.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method.

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Recently, researchers in the area of biosensor based human emotion recognition have used different types of machine learning models for recognizing human emotions. However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain. ",

            "abstract": "Swarm robotics is a well-evolved research area over the past couple of decades. In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

(Cryptoeprint:2017:441) showed a novel approach of constructing several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives by introducing a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE). Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441).",

Security models for two-party authenticated key exchange protocols have been developed over time to provide security even when the adversary learns certain secret values.

However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

It is an interesting work to review the meaningful security properties provided by these security models. This work review how a leakage resilient security model for a key exchange protocol has been evolved over years according to the increasing security requirement which covers a different range of attacks. The relationship on how an adversary capability in the leakage resilient security model can be related to real-world attack scenarios is studied. The analysis work for each leakage resilient security model here enables a better knowledge on how an adversary query addresses different leakage attacks setting, thereby understand the motive of design for a cryptographic primitive in the security model.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to construct several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives, including leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols and low-latency key exchange (LLKE) protocols. To this end, we introduce a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE) protocol. We introduce an appropriate security model for LR-NIKE protocols in the bounded memory leakage (BML) settings. We then show a secure construction of the LR-NIKE protocol in the BML setting that achieves an optimal leakage rate, i.e., 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 o(1). Our construction of LR-NIKE requires a minimal use of a leak-free hardware component. We argue that the use of such a leak-free hardware component seems to be unavoidable in any construction of an LR-NIKE protocol, even in the BML setting. Finally, we show how to construct the aforementioned leakage-resilient primitives from such an LR-NIKE protocol as summarized below. All these primitives also achieve the same (optimal) leakage rate as the underlying LR-NIKE protocol. We show how to construct a leakage-resilient (LR) IND-CCA-2-secure PKE scheme in the BML model generically from a bounded LR-NIKE (BLR-NIKE) protocol. Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

            "abstract": "Over the years, security against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA2) is considered as the strongest security definition for public-key encryption schemes. With the uprise of side-channel attacks, new security definitions are proposed, addressing leakage of secret keys together with the standard CCA2 definition. Among the new security definitions, security against continuous and after-the-fact leakage-resilient CCA2 can be considered as the strongest security definition, which is called as security against (continuous) adaptively chosen-ciphertext leakage attacks (continuous CCLA2). In this paper, we present a construction of a public-key encryption scheme, namely LR-PKE, which satisfies the aforementioned security definition. The security of our public-key encryption scheme is proven in the standard model, under decision BDH assumption. Thus, we emphasize that our public-key encryption scheme LR-PKE is (continuous) CCLA2-secure in the standard model. For our construction of LR-PKE, we have used a strong one-time signature scheme and a leakage-resilient refreshing protocol as underlying building blocks. The leakage bound is 0.15nlogp\u00e2\u0088\u00921 bits per leakage query, for a security parameter k and a statistical security parameter n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0, such that logp\u00e2\u0089\u00a5k and n is a function of k\u00e2\u0081\u00a0. It is possible to see that LR-PKE is efficient enough to be used for real-world usage.",

Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",
