            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process. In the paper we have measured, compared and reported the time taken for the protein inference process in our framework against a pure software implementation.",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

In this paper, we propose a content based image retrieval system based on three major types of visual information: colour, texture and shape, and their distances to the origin in a three dimensional space for the retrieval. We experimentally investigated several feature extraction methods and learning algorithms for content based image retrieval.

            "abstract": "Recently, Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441) showed a novel approach of constructing several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives by introducing a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE). Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441).",

            "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) applications in smart agricultural systems vary from monitoring climate conditions, automating irrigation systems, greenhouse automation, crop monitoring and management, and crop prediction, up to end-to-end autonomous farm management systems. One of the main challenges to the advancement of IoT systems for the agricultural domain is the lack of training data under operational environmental conditions. Most of the current designs are based on simulations and artificially generated data. Therefore, the essential first step is studying and understanding the finely tuned and highly sensitive mechanism plants have developed to sense, respond, and adapt to changes in their environment, and their behavior under field and controlled systems. Therefore, this study was designed to achieve two specific objectives; to develop low-cost IoT components from basic building blocks, and to study the performance of the developed systems, and generate real-time experimental data, with and without plants. Low-cost IoT devices developed locally were used to convert existing basic polytunnels to semi-controlled and monitoring-only polytunnels. Their performances were analyzed and compared with each other based on several matrices while maintaining the planted tomato variety and agronomic practices similar. The developed system performed as expected suggesting the possibility of commercial applications and research purposes.",

Although Aho-Corasick was one of the commonly used exact multiple strings matching algorithm, Commentz-Walter has been introduced as a better alternative in the recent past. Comments-Walter algorithm combines ideas from both Aho-Corasick and Boyer Moore. Large scale rapid and accurate peptide identification is critical in computational proteomics. In this paper, we have critically analyzed the time complexity of Aho-Corasick and Commentz-Walter for their suitability in large scale peptide identification. According to the results we obtained for our dataset, we conclude that Aho-Corasick is performing better than Commentz-Walter as opposed to the common beliefs.",

Much work has been done in this area, yet there is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

            "abstract": "Embedded systems are ubiquitous and are deployed in a large range of applications. Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

An image contains several types of visual information which are difficult to extract and combine manually by humans. In this paper, we propose a content based image retrieval system based on three major types of visual information: colour, texture and shape, and their distances to the origin in a three dimensional space for the retrieval. We experimentally investigated several feature extraction methods and learning algorithms for content based image retrieval. The results show that 5-Nearest Neighbour yield the highest accuracy for the chosen feature extraction methods.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

            "abstract": "With the development of side-channel attacks, a necessity arises to invent authenticated key exchange protocols in a leakage-resilient manner. Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

The existing accurate detection mechanism (pulse oximetry) is a skin contact measurement. The existing non-contact mechanisms (acoustics, video processing) are not accurate enough. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer.

The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesnt need failure links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences.",

A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "Compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth. Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

            "abstract": "With the development of side-channel attacks, a necessity arises to invent authenticated key exchange protocols in a leakage-resilient manner. Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

An image contains several types of visual information which are difficult to extract and combine manually by humans. In this paper, we propose a content based image retrieval system based on three major types of visual information: colour, texture and shape, and their distances to the origin in a three dimensional space for the retrieval. We experimentally investigated several feature extraction methods and learning algorithms for content based image retrieval. The results show that 5-Nearest Neighbour yield the highest accuracy for the chosen feature extraction methods.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

The focus here is on the exploratory behavior of swarm robotics, including aggregation, dispersion, and collective movement. The system is represented as an occupancy grid problem and heuristic-based algorithms are used as optimized solutions. The decentralized approach within those methods makes them easier to idealize with current swarm robotic applications. Furthermore, these algorithms can be seamlessly integrated with other current frontier-based exploration techniques to enhance robot cooperation. All these proposed methods have been tested in different simulation environments, which mimic real world scenarios.",

Although Aho-Corasick was one of the commonly used exact multiple strings matching algorithm, Commentz-Walter has been introduced as a better alternative in the recent past. Comments-Walter algorithm combines ideas from both Aho-Corasick and Boyer Moore. Large scale rapid and accurate peptide identification is critical in computational proteomics. In this paper, we have critically analyzed the time complexity of Aho-Corasick and Commentz-Walter for their suitability in large scale peptide identification. According to the results we obtained for our dataset, we conclude that Aho-Corasick is performing better than Commentz-Walter as opposed to the common beliefs.",

In this paper, we reveal vulnerabilities and weaknesses of WEP protocol which is used in IEEE 802.11b. The major issue of WEP protocol is the lack of a proper key management technique. We propose a method to overcome above by introducing a dynamic key for authentication and data transmission on per data frame basis.",

            "abstract": "Compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth. Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance.

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "A Byzantine fault is a failure that cannot be identified by observing the output of a component; the component produces a wrong result as opposed to not producing a result at all or producing a result that can be identified as wrong. Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

A large number of methods have been proposed and investigated in both areas but satisfactory general solution have still no been developed. An image contains several types of visual information which are difficult to extract and combine manually by humans. In this paper, we propose a content based image retrieval system based on three major types of visual information: colour, texture and shape, and their distances to the origin in a three dimensional space for the retrieval. We experimentally investigated several feature extraction methods and learning algorithms for content based image retrieval. The results show that 5-Nearest Neighbour yield the highest accuracy for the chosen feature extraction methods.",

            "abstract": "Plagiarism is one of the growing issues in academia and is always a concern in Universities and other academic institutions. The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

            "abstract": "User interfaces in mobile applications are complex since they need to provide sufficient features to variety of users in a restricted space where a small number of components are available. When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441) showed a novel approach of constructing several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives by introducing a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE). Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441).",

            "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) applications in smart agricultural systems vary from monitoring climate conditions, automating irrigation systems, greenhouse automation, crop monitoring and management, and crop prediction, up to end-to-end autonomous farm management systems. One of the main challenges to the advancement of IoT systems for the agricultural domain is the lack of training data under operational environmental conditions. Most of the current designs are based on simulations and artificially generated data. Therefore, the essential first step is studying and understanding the finely tuned and highly sensitive mechanism plants have developed to sense, respond, and adapt to changes in their environment, and their behavior under field and controlled systems. Therefore, this study was designed to achieve two specific objectives; to develop low-cost IoT components from basic building blocks, and to study the performance of the developed systems, and generate real-time experimental data, with and without plants. Low-cost IoT devices developed locally were used to convert existing basic polytunnels to semi-controlled and monitoring-only polytunnels. Their performances were analyzed and compared with each other based on several matrices while maintaining the planted tomato variety and agronomic practices similar. The developed system performed as expected suggesting the possibility of commercial applications and research purposes.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

A plethora of research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism and the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease. To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources. We also present a critical analysis of the propose machine learning framework using GSE5281 gene dataset.",

            "abstract": "Compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth. Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance. The paper also analyses the functionality and the performance of different components, hidden layers, and the entire pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

            "abstract": "Header compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth and reduces latency. However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

            "year": "2025",
            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently gained traction in plant disease classification due to their strong performance in visual recognition tasks. However, their application to tomato leaf disease recognition remains challenged by two factors, namely the need for models that can generalise across diverse disease conditions and the absence of a unified framework for systematic comparison. Existing ViT-based approaches often yield inconsistent results across datasets and disease types, limiting their reliability and practical deployment. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ViT-Based Robust Framework (ViT-RoT), a novel benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the performance of various ViT architectures in tomato leaf disease classification. The framework facilitates the systematic classification of state-of-the-art ViT variants into high-, moderate-, and low-performing groups for tomato leaf disease recognition. A thorough empirical analysis is conducted using one publicly available benchmark dataset, assessed through standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that the ConvNeXt-Small and Swin-Small models consistently achieve superior accuracy and robustness across all datasets. Beyond identifying the most effective ViT variant, the study highlights critical considerations for designing ViT-based models that are not only accurate but also efficient and adaptable to real-world agricultural applications. This study contributes a structured foundation for future research and development in vision-based plant disease diagnosis.",

A plethora of research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism and the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease. To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources. We also present a critical analysis of the propose machine learning framework using GSE5281 gene dataset.",

One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

            "abstract": "Plagiarism is one of the growing issues in academia and is always a concern in Universities and other academic institutions. The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

            "abstract": "Header compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth and reduces latency. However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

This study examines the complex nature of the disease by analyzing weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity. Through machine learning techniques, we successfully forecasted dengue outbreaks in nine districts in Sri Lanka and identified similar weather and dengue patterns in districts such as Gampaha, Colombo, Kandy and Kurunegala. These findings are important for developing an early warning system, optimizing public health measures, and efficiently allocating resources to minimize the negative impact on communities. Furthermore, the model offers valuable insights for epidemiological research on dengue spread and control.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "Plagiarism is one of the growing issues in academia and is always a concern in Universities and other academic institutions. The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

            "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth. Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

In this work our effort is to implement two leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes, a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol, which have been proven-secure and accepted by the cryptographic community since 2011 (ASIACRYPT 2011). Our aim is to open up the direction for implementing the useful leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes for future usage.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analysing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analysed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (MiBench, MediaBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analysed for two different architectures (ARM-Thumb and PISA). Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless of the architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources.

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process. In the paper we have measured, compared and reported the time taken for the protein inference process in our framework against a pure software implementation.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources.

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analysing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analysed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (MiBench, MediaBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analysed for two different architectures (ARM-Thumb and PISA). Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless of the architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance.

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

However, advances in in situ genomics require parallel development of portable, offline solutions for the computational analysis of sequencing data. Here we introduce Genopo, a mobile toolkit for nanopore sequencing analysis. Genopo compacts popular bioinformatics tools to an Android application, enabling fully portable computation. To demonstrate its utility for in situ genome analysis, we use Genopo to determine the complete genome sequence of the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in nine patient isolates sequenced on a nanopore device, with Genopo executing this workflow in less than 30\u00e2\u0080\u0089min per sample on a range of popular smartphones. We further show how Genopo can be used to profile DNA methylation in a human genome sample, illustrating a flexible, efficient architecture that is suitable to run many popular bioinformatics tools and accommodate small or large genomes. As the first ever smartphone application for nanopore sequencing analysis, Genopo enables the genomics community to harness this cheap, ubiquitous computational resource.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

These attacks have become a huge threat for embedded systems, in which the security depends on the secret encryption key for the ciphers. Hence, many researchers try to find vulnerabilities of cryptosystems against power analysis attacks, so that they can develop countermeasures to ensure the security of such systems. In this paper, we review some of the recent power analysis attacks on modern hardware stream ciphers such as Trivium, Grain and MICKEY.",

In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

Greenhouses are used to increase harvest by controlling key factors which will aect the planet growth. Real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environment and taking necessary control decisions will result in improvement of yields and economic performance. In this Research paper, we propose an environmental monitoring and controlling system that have the ability to collect the information related to greenhouse environment using various sensors. This system provides the ability to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely via a web interface and a mobile application. Using a low-cost wireless sensor network, environment data on greenhouse are sent to the centralized server. It will store all this data and show the latest environment details of the greenhouse using the web interface. The web interface will provide a real-time graphical display of data using charts and gauges and ability to send control decisions to the central node which is necessary to increase harvest and improve the quality of crops.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

Much work has been done in this area, yet there is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides.

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

            "abstract": "It is of critical importance to satisfy deadline requirements for an embedded application to avoid undesired outcomes. Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) play a vital role in contemporary embedded devices to satisfy timing deadlines. Such MPSoCs include two-level cache hierarchies which have to be dimensioned carefully to support timing deadlines of the application(s) while consuming minimum area and therefore minimum power. Given the deadline of an application, it is possible to systematically derive the maximum time that could be spent on memory accesses which can then be used to dimension the suitable cache sizes. As the dimensioning has to be done rapidly to satisfy the time to market requirement, we choose a well acclaimed rapid cache simulation strategy, the single-pass trace driven simulation, for estimating the cache dimensions. Therefore, for the first time, we address the two main challenges, coherency and scalability, in adapting a single-pass simulator to a MPSoC with two-level cache hierarchy. The challenges are addressed through a modular bottom-up simulation technique where L1 and L2 simulations are handled in independent communicating modules. In this paper, we present how the dimensioning is performed for a two-level inclusive data cache hierarchy in an MPSoC. With the rapid simulation proposed, the estimations are suggested within an hour (worst case on considered application benchmarks). We experimented our approach with task based MPSoC implementations of JPEG and H264 benchmarks and achieved timing deviations of 16.1% and 7.2% respectively on average against the requested data access times. The deviation numbers are always positive meaning our simulator guarantees to satisfy the requested data access time. In addition, we generated a set of synthetic memory traces and used them to extensively analyse our simulator. For the synthetic traces, our simulator provides cache sizes to always guarantee the requested data access time, deviating below 14.5% on average.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

            "abstract": "A Byzantine fault is a failure that cannot be identified by observing the output of a component; the component produces a wrong result as opposed to not producing a result at all or producing a result that can be identified as wrong. Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Swarm robotics is a well-evolved research area over the past couple of decades. In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

Countermeasures by software-only approaches increasecodesize by large amounts and therefore significantly reduce performance. Hardware assisted approaches add extensive amountsofhardware monitors and thus incur unacceptably highhardware cost. This paper presents a novel hardware/softwaretechniqueat the granularity of micro-instructions to reduce overheads considerably. Experiments show thatour technique incurs an additional hardware overhead of 0.91% and clock period increase of 0.06%. Average clock cycle and code size overheads are just 11.9% and 10.6% forfive industrystandard application benchmarks. These overheads are far smaller than have been previously encountered.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

Countermeasures by software-only approaches increasecodesize by large amounts and therefore significantly reduce performance. Hardware assisted approaches add extensive amountsofhardware monitors and thus incur unacceptably highhardware cost. This paper presents a novel hardware/softwaretechniqueat the granularity of micro-instructions to reduce overheads considerably. Experiments show thatour technique incurs an additional hardware overhead of 0.91% and clock period increase of 0.06%. Average clock cycle and code size overheads are just 11.9% and 10.6% forfive industrystandard application benchmarks. These overheads are far smaller than have been previously encountered.",

            "abstract": "It is of critical importance to satisfy deadline requirements for an embedded application to avoid undesired outcomes. Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) play a vital role in contemporary embedded devices to satisfy timing deadlines. Such MPSoCs include two-level cache hierarchies which have to be dimensioned carefully to support timing deadlines of the application(s) while consuming minimum area and therefore minimum power. Given the deadline of an application, it is possible to systematically derive the maximum time that could be spent on memory accesses which can then be used to dimension the suitable cache sizes. As the dimensioning has to be done rapidly to satisfy the time to market requirement, we choose a well acclaimed rapid cache simulation strategy, the single-pass trace driven simulation, for estimating the cache dimensions. Therefore, for the first time, we address the two main challenges, coherency and scalability, in adapting a single-pass simulator to a MPSoC with two-level cache hierarchy. The challenges are addressed through a modular bottom-up simulation technique where L1 and L2 simulations are handled in independent communicating modules. In this paper, we present how the dimensioning is performed for a two-level inclusive data cache hierarchy in an MPSoC. With the rapid simulation proposed, the estimations are suggested within an hour (worst case on considered application benchmarks). We experimented our approach with task based MPSoC implementations of JPEG and H264 benchmarks and achieved timing deviations of 16.1% and 7.2% respectively on average against the requested data access times. The deviation numbers are always positive meaning our simulator guarantees to satisfy the requested data access time. In addition, we generated a set of synthetic memory traces and used them to extensively analyse our simulator. For the synthetic traces, our simulator provides cache sizes to always guarantee the requested data access time, deviating below 14.5% on average.",

The two methods have been empirically evaluated on three types of high-dimensional datasets: microarrays, chemoinformatics, and images. Experimental results on 34 datasets show that both the random subspace and the random projection method lead to improvements in predictive performance compared to using the standard nearest neighbor classifier, while the best method to use depends on the type of data considered; for the microarray and chemoinformatics datasets, random projection outperforms the random subspace method, while the opposite holds for the image datasets. An analysis using data complexity measures, such as attribute to instance ratio and Fisher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discriminant ratio, provide some more detailed indications on what relative performance can be expected for specific datasets. The results also indicate that the resulting ensembles may be competitive with state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers; the nearest neighbor ensembles using random projection perform on par with random forests for the microarray and chemoinformatics datasets.",

            "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

            "abstract": "User interfaces in mobile applications are complex since they need to provide sufficient features to variety of users in a restricted space where a small number of components are available. When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the design and optimization of a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architecture for low-resource JPEG encoding. The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Intrinsic Image Decomposition is an open problem of generating the constituents of an image. Generating reflectance and shading from a single image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly. We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example images) showing several avenues for improvement.",

A large number of methods have been proposed and investigated in both areas but satisfactory general solution have still no been developed. An image contains several types of visual information which are difficult to extract and combine manually by humans. In this paper, we propose a content based image retrieval system based on three major types of visual information: colour, texture and shape, and their distances to the origin in a three dimensional space for the retrieval. We experimentally investigated several feature extraction methods and learning algorithms for content based image retrieval. The results show that 5-Nearest Neighbour yield the highest accuracy for the chosen feature extraction methods.",

Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "A Byzantine fault is a failure that cannot be identified by observing the output of a component; the component produces a wrong result as opposed to not producing a result at all or producing a result that can be identified as wrong. Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

This product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analysing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analysed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (MiBench, MediaBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analysed for two different architectures (ARM-Thumb and PISA). Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless of the architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an autonomic trust management framework for cloud based and highly dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) applications in smart agricultural systems vary from monitoring climate conditions, automating irrigation systems, greenhouse automation, crop monitoring and management, and crop prediction, up to end-to-end autonomous farm management systems. One of the main challenges to the advancement of IoT systems for the agricultural domain is the lack of training data under operational environmental conditions. Most of the current designs are based on simulations and artificially generated data. Therefore, the essential first step is studying and understanding the finely tuned and highly sensitive mechanism plants have developed to sense, respond, and adapt to changes in their environment, and their behavior under field and controlled systems. Therefore, this study was designed to achieve two specific objectives; to develop low-cost IoT components from basic building blocks, and to study the performance of the developed systems, and generate real-time experimental data, with and without plants. Low-cost IoT devices developed locally were used to convert existing basic polytunnels to semi-controlled and monitoring-only polytunnels. Their performances were analyzed and compared with each other based on several matrices while maintaining the planted tomato variety and agronomic practices similar. The developed system performed as expected suggesting the possibility of commercial applications and research purposes.",

Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "A Byzantine fault is a failure that cannot be identified by observing the output of a component; the component produces a wrong result as opposed to not producing a result at all or producing a result that can be identified as wrong. Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

Then, the key exchange protocol is proved with leakage resilient security model to determine whether its security proof can provide the security properties it claimed or to find out any unexamined flaw during protocol building. It is an interesting work to review the meaningful security properties provided by these security models. This work review how a leakage resilient security model for a key exchange protocol has been evolved over years according to the increasing security requirement which covers a different range of attacks. The relationship on how an adversary capability in the leakage resilient security model can be related to real-world attack scenarios is studied. The analysis work for each leakage resilient security model here enables a better knowledge on how an adversary query addresses different leakage attacks setting, thereby understand the motive of design for a cryptographic primitive in the security model.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441) showed a novel approach of constructing several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives by introducing a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE). Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441).",

In this paper we address the partial leakage of long-term secret keys of key exchange protocol participants due to various side-channel attacks. Security models for two-party authenticated key exchange protocols have been developed over time to provide security even when the adversary learns certain secret values. This paper combines and extends the advances of security modelling for AKE protocols addressing more granular partial leakage of long-term secrets of protocol participants. Further, we fix some flaws in security proofs of previous leakage-resilient key exchange protocols.",

It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441) showed a novel approach of constructing several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives by introducing a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE). Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al. (Cryptoeprint:2017:441).",

Then, the key exchange protocol is proved with leakage resilient security model to determine whether its security proof can provide the security properties it claimed or to find out any unexamined flaw during protocol building. It is an interesting work to review the meaningful security properties provided by these security models. This work review how a leakage resilient security model for a key exchange protocol has been evolved over years according to the increasing security requirement which covers a different range of attacks. The relationship on how an adversary capability in the leakage resilient security model can be related to real-world attack scenarios is studied. The analysis work for each leakage resilient security model here enables a better knowledge on how an adversary query addresses different leakage attacks setting, thereby understand the motive of design for a cryptographic primitive in the security model.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to construct several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives, including leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols and low-latency key exchange (LLKE) protocols. To this end, we introduce a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE) protocol. We introduce an appropriate security model for LR-NIKE protocols in the bounded memory leakage (BML) settings. We then show a secure construction of the LR-NIKE protocol in the BML setting that achieves an optimal leakage rate, i.e., 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 o(1). Our construction of LR-NIKE requires a minimal use of a leak-free hardware component. We argue that the use of such a leak-free hardware component seems to be unavoidable in any construction of an LR-NIKE protocol, even in the BML setting. Finally, we show how to construct the aforementioned leakage-resilient primitives from such an LR-NIKE protocol as summarized below. All these primitives also achieve the same (optimal) leakage rate as the underlying LR-NIKE protocol. We show how to construct a leakage-resilient (LR) IND-CCA-2-secure PKE scheme in the BML model generically from a bounded LR-NIKE (BLR-NIKE) protocol. Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

            "abstract": "With the development of side-channel attacks, a necessity arises to invent authenticated key exchange protocols in a leakage-resilient manner. Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance. The paper also analyses the functionality and the performance of different components, hidden layers, and the entire pipeline.",

            "abstract": "Currently there is a new trend in the design of Complex Reactive Systems (CRS) towards model based development. Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

These attacks have become a huge threat for embedded systems, in which the security depends on the secret encryption key for the ciphers. Hence, many researchers try to find vulnerabilities of cryptosystems against power analysis attacks, so that they can develop countermeasures to ensure the security of such systems.

A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

            "abstract": "Dengue outbreaks pose a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions globally, necessitating effective predictive models for early detection and intervention. This study examines the complex nature of the disease by analyzing weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity. Through machine learning techniques, we successfully forecasted dengue outbreaks in nine districts in Sri Lanka and identified similar weather and dengue patterns in districts such as Gampaha, Colombo, Kandy and Kurunegala. These findings are important for developing an early warning system, optimizing public health measures, and efficiently allocating resources to minimize the negative impact on communities. Furthermore, the model offers valuable insights for epidemiological research on dengue spread and control.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "Fast Internet connectivity and billions of web sites have made World Wide Web an attractive place for people to use the Internet in their day-to-day life. Educational institutes provide the Internet access to students mainly for educational purposes. However, most of the time, students are allowed to access any content on the web. Therefore, the full bandwidth is consumed due to access to non-educational content such as streaming non-educational videos and downloading large image files, etc. Prevention of Internet usage on non-education content is practically difficult due to various reasons. Usually, this is implemented in the proxy server through maintaining a blacklist of URLs. Most of the time, this is a static list of URLs. With the fast growing content on the World Wide Web maintaining a static blacklist is impractical. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate dynamic blacklist of URLs using machine learning techniques. We experimentally investigate several machine learning algorithms to predict whether the URL in concern is educational or noneducational. The results of the initial experiments show that linear support vector machines can be used to predict the content with 98.9% accuracy.",

This exercise is useful for establishing a guideline for a series of online short courses for them. A group of 412 students' access behaviour in an e-learning system were analysed and they were grouped into clusters using K-Means clustering method according to their course access log records. The results explained that more than 40% from the student group are passive online learners in both graded and non-graded learning environments. The result showed that the difference in the learning environments could change the online access behaviour of a student group. Clustering divided the student population into five access groups based on their course access behaviour. Among these groups, the least access group (NG-41% and G-42%) and the highest access group (NG-9% and G-5%) could be identified very clearly due to their access variation from the rest of the groups.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

            "abstract": "Currently there is a new trend in the design of Complex Reactive Systems (CRS) towards model based development. Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

The focus here is on the exploratory behavior of swarm robotics, including aggregation, dispersion, and collective movement. The system is represented as an occupancy grid problem and heuristic-based algorithms are used as optimized solutions. The decentralized approach within those methods makes them easier to idealize with current swarm robotic applications. Furthermore, these algorithms can be seamlessly integrated with other current frontier-based exploration techniques to enhance robot cooperation. All these proposed methods have been tested in different simulation environments, which mimic real world scenarios.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "User interfaces in mobile applications are complex since they need to provide sufficient features to variety of users in a restricted space where a small number of components are available. When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

To minimize the disciplinary issues emerged from the previous research on mobile devices and to enhance the quality of learning, a set of mobile phones that are connected to a private network was used. The lesson planning and implementation through these mobile phones were facilitated by a web based Application. A purposively selected group of teachers developed three lessons while integrating mobile phones in a private network into learning activities. Then the lessons were implemented in real classroom settings. This paper is based on one of the lessons \u00e2\u0080\u0098Waves and their Characteristics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that was implemented for Grade 11 students. The data were collected through observations using audio, video and field notes and were analyzed using thematic analysis technique with the help of NVivo10 qualitative data analysis software. Based on the thematic analysis, two assertions were derived. Notably teachers appreciated the support of the private network in enhancing the quality of group learning activity while minimizing the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 misuse of mobile phones.",

Greenhouses are used to increase harvest by controlling key factors which will aect the planet growth. Real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environment and taking necessary control decisions will result in improvement of yields and economic performance. In this Research paper, we propose an environmental monitoring and controlling system that have the ability to collect the information related to greenhouse environment using various sensors. This system provides the ability to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely via a web interface and a mobile application. Using a low-cost wireless sensor network, environment data on greenhouse are sent to the centralized server. It will store all this data and show the latest environment details of the greenhouse using the web interface. The web interface will provide a real-time graphical display of data using charts and gauges and ability to send control decisions to the central node which is necessary to increase harvest and improve the quality of crops.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "Automatic question answering (QA) is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. Here the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. In this paper we used a template matching technique to perform this matching. The first part of the paper discusses about an automatic question answering system that we have developed using template matching techniques. The approach adopted is an automated FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) answering system that provides pre-stored answers to user questions asked in ordinary English and SMS language. The system also has techniques to overcome spelling and grammar mistakes introduced in questions by its users and therefore user-friendly compared to restricted syntax based approaches. The second part of the paper studies three techniques for performance evaluation in the above system which are based on template matching approach: 1) Random classification of templates, 2) Similarity based classification of templates, 3) Weighting template words.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "The advent of portable nanopore sequencing devices has enabled DNA and RNA sequencing to be performed in the field or the clinic. However, advances in in situ genomics require parallel development of portable, offline solutions for the computational analysis of sequencing data. Here we introduce Genopo, a mobile toolkit for nanopore sequencing analysis. Genopo compacts popular bioinformatics tools to an Android application, enabling fully portable computation. To demonstrate its utility for in situ genome analysis, we use Genopo to determine the complete genome sequence of the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in nine patient isolates sequenced on a nanopore device, with Genopo executing this workflow in less than 30\u00e2\u0080\u0089min per sample on a range of popular smartphones. We further show how Genopo can be used to profile DNA methylation in a human genome sample, illustrating a flexible, efficient architecture that is suitable to run many popular bioinformatics tools and accommodate small or large genomes. As the first ever smartphone application for nanopore sequencing analysis, Genopo enables the genomics community to harness this cheap, ubiquitous computational resource.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

            "abstract": "The random subspace and the random projection methods are investigated and compared as techniques for forming ensembles of nearest neighbor classifiers in high dimensional feature spaces. The two methods have been empirically evaluated on three types of high-dimensional datasets: microarrays, chemoinformatics, and images. Experimental results on 34 datasets show that both the random subspace and the random projection method lead to improvements in predictive performance compared to using the standard nearest neighbor classifier, while the best method to use depends on the type of data considered; for the microarray and chemoinformatics datasets, random projection outperforms the random subspace method, while the opposite holds for the image datasets. An analysis using data complexity measures, such as attribute to instance ratio and Fisher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discriminant ratio, provide some more detailed indications on what relative performance can be expected for specific datasets. The results also indicate that the resulting ensembles may be competitive with state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers; the nearest neighbor ensembles using random projection perform on par with random forests for the microarray and chemoinformatics datasets.",

This product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

Generating reflectance and shading from a single image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly. We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example images) showing several avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed.

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesnt need failure links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences.",

The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesnt need failure links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences.",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer.

Although Aho-Corasick was one of the commonly used exact multiple strings matching algorithm, Commentz-Walter has been introduced as a better alternative in the recent past. Comments-Walter algorithm combines ideas from both Aho-Corasick and Boyer Moore. Large scale rapid and accurate peptide identification is critical in computational proteomics. In this paper, we have critically analyzed the time complexity of Aho-Corasick and Commentz-Walter for their suitability in large scale peptide identification. According to the results we obtained for our dataset, we conclude that Aho-Corasick is performing better than Commentz-Walter as opposed to the common beliefs.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides.

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

            "abstract": "Embedded systems are ubiquitous and are deployed in a large range of applications. Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.",

            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently gained traction in plant disease classification due to their strong performance in visual recognition tasks. However, their application to tomato leaf disease recognition remains challenged by two factors, namely the need for models that can generalise across diverse disease conditions and the absence of a unified framework for systematic comparison. Existing ViT-based approaches often yield inconsistent results across datasets and disease types, limiting their reliability and practical deployment. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ViT-Based Robust Framework (ViT-RoT), a novel benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the performance of various ViT architectures in tomato leaf disease classification. The framework facilitates the systematic classification of state-of-the-art ViT variants into high-, moderate-, and low-performing groups for tomato leaf disease recognition. A thorough empirical analysis is conducted using one publicly available benchmark dataset, assessed through standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that the ConvNeXt-Small and Swin-Small models consistently achieve superior accuracy and robustness across all datasets. Beyond identifying the most effective ViT variant, the study highlights critical considerations for designing ViT-based models that are not only accurate but also efficient and adaptable to real-world agricultural applications. This study contributes a structured foundation for future research and development in vision-based plant disease diagnosis.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

            "year": "2025",
            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently gained traction in plant disease classification due to their strong performance in visual recognition tasks. However, their application to tomato leaf disease recognition remains challenged by two factors, namely the need for models that can generalise across diverse disease conditions and the absence of a unified framework for systematic comparison. Existing ViT-based approaches often yield inconsistent results across datasets and disease types, limiting their reliability and practical deployment. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ViT-Based Robust Framework (ViT-RoT), a novel benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the performance of various ViT architectures in tomato leaf disease classification. The framework facilitates the systematic classification of state-of-the-art ViT variants into high-, moderate-, and low-performing groups for tomato leaf disease recognition. A thorough empirical analysis is conducted using one publicly available benchmark dataset, assessed through standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that the ConvNeXt-Small and Swin-Small models consistently achieve superior accuracy and robustness across all datasets. Beyond identifying the most effective ViT variant, the study highlights critical considerations for designing ViT-based models that are not only accurate but also efficient and adaptable to real-world agricultural applications. This study contributes a structured foundation for future research and development in vision-based plant disease diagnosis.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

A plethora of research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism and the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease. To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources. We also present a critical analysis of the propose machine learning framework using GSE5281 gene dataset.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

            "abstract": "Swarm robotics is a well-evolved research area over the past couple of decades. In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

Much work has been done in this area, yet there is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process. In the paper we have measured, compared and reported the time taken for the protein inference process in our framework against a pure software implementation.",

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

            "abstract": "Since the side-channel attacks arise as a huge threat for cryptographic schemes than previously realized, it is necessary to implement proven-secure leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes and use them for real-world purposes. In this work our effort is to implement two leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes, a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol, which have been proven-secure and accepted by the cryptographic community since 2011 (ASIACRYPT 2011). Our aim is to open up the direction for implementing the useful leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes for future usage.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

In this paper, we reveal vulnerabilities and weaknesses of WEP protocol which is used in IEEE 802.11b. The major issue of WEP protocol is the lack of a proper key management technique. We propose a method to overcome above by introducing a dynamic key for authentication and data transmission on per data frame basis.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

Generating reflectance and shading from a single image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly. We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example images) showing several avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse has been the best alternative solution to get a better crop production compared to the traditional agricultural industry. Greenhouses are used to increase harvest by controlling key factors which will aect the planet growth. Real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environment and taking necessary control decisions will result in improvement of yields and economic performance. In this Research paper, we propose an environmental monitoring and controlling system that have the ability to collect the information related to greenhouse environment using various sensors. This system provides the ability to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely via a web interface and a mobile application. Using a low-cost wireless sensor network, environment data on greenhouse are sent to the centralized server. It will store all this data and show the latest environment details of the greenhouse using the web interface. The web interface will provide a real-time graphical display of data using charts and gauges and ability to send control decisions to the central node which is necessary to increase harvest and improve the quality of crops.",

            "abstract": "User interfaces in mobile applications are complex since they need to provide sufficient features to variety of users in a restricted space where a small number of components are available. When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance. The paper also analyses the functionality and the performance of different components, hidden layers, and the entire pipeline.",

In this paper, we introduce a framework for programming swarm robots in a novel approach based on behaviour categorization, pheromone communication, and state representation. The framework is packaged with a set of well defined and tested behaviours that are structured based on the level of interactions between robots. These behaviours can be combined and integrated into the user code when implementing new behaviours. Robots function in a user-defined state and perform actions attributed to that state. We have used a behaviour- based bottom-up design approach for designing these behaviours which eventually alleviate the debugging and implementation process. The efficacy of our work is validated using results obtained from a custom-built simulation platform. These results include tests involving an random movement behaviour, an object finding behaviour, and implementation of an aggregation behaviour.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

Countermeasures by software-only approaches increasecodesize by large amounts and therefore significantly reduce performance. Hardware assisted approaches add extensive amountsofhardware monitors and thus incur unacceptably highhardware cost. This paper presents a novel hardware/softwaretechniqueat the granularity of micro-instructions to reduce overheads considerably. Experiments show thatour technique incurs an additional hardware overhead of 0.91% and clock period increase of 0.06%. Average clock cycle and code size overheads are just 11.9% and 10.6% forfive industrystandard application benchmarks. These overheads are far smaller than have been previously encountered.",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

These solutions are expected to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested and have been verified.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "The potential of mobile phones to facilitate students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 science learning, when they are engaging in group activities, was investigated. To minimize the disciplinary issues emerged from the previous research on mobile devices and to enhance the quality of learning, a set of mobile phones that are connected to a private network was used. The lesson planning and implementation through these mobile phones were facilitated by a web based Application. A purposively selected group of teachers developed three lessons while integrating mobile phones in a private network into learning activities. Then the lessons were implemented in real classroom settings. This paper is based on one of the lessons \u00e2\u0080\u0098Waves and their Characteristics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that was implemented for Grade 11 students. The data were collected through observations using audio, video and field notes and were analyzed using thematic analysis technique with the help of NVivo10 qualitative data analysis software. Based on the thematic analysis, two assertions were derived. Notably teachers appreciated the support of the private network in enhancing the quality of group learning activity while minimizing the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 misuse of mobile phones.",

This product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",

            "abstract": "In leakage resilient cryptography, leakage resilient key exchange protocols are constructed to defend against leakage attacks. Then, the key exchange protocol is proved with leakage resilient security model to determine whether its security proof can provide the security properties it claimed or to find out any unexamined flaw during protocol building. It is an interesting work to review the meaningful security properties provided by these security models. This work review how a leakage resilient security model for a key exchange protocol has been evolved over years according to the increasing security requirement which covers a different range of attacks. The relationship on how an adversary capability in the leakage resilient security model can be related to real-world attack scenarios is studied. The analysis work for each leakage resilient security model here enables a better knowledge on how an adversary query addresses different leakage attacks setting, thereby understand the motive of design for a cryptographic primitive in the security model.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

            "abstract": "Embedded systems are ubiquitous and are deployed in a large range of applications. Designing and fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) targeting such different range of applications is expensive. Designers seek flexible processors which efficiently execute a multitude of applications. FPGAs are considered affordable, but design cost, high reconfiguration delay and power consumption are all prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel ASIC based flexible MPSoC architecture, which can execute separate tasks in parallel, and it can be configured to execute single task with wide data widths or execute multiple tasks with varying data widths. The architecture presented, called Dynamically Reconfigurable MPSoC Architecture (DRMA), can be rapidly reconfigured through instructions. We present applications as case studies to showcase the flexibility and efficacy of DRMA. Results show for an additional area overhead of about 5%, the system is capable of working as four 32-bit processors, a single 128 bit processor or as a pipelined processing system.",

Greenhouses are used to increase harvest by controlling key factors which will aect the planet growth. Real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environment and taking necessary control decisions will result in improvement of yields and economic performance. In this Research paper, we propose an environmental monitoring and controlling system that have the ability to collect the information related to greenhouse environment using various sensors. This system provides the ability to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely via a web interface and a mobile application. Using a low-cost wireless sensor network, environment data on greenhouse are sent to the centralized server. It will store all this data and show the latest environment details of the greenhouse using the web interface. The web interface will provide a real-time graphical display of data using charts and gauges and ability to send control decisions to the central node which is necessary to increase harvest and improve the quality of crops.",

One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

Differently, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. This side channel has led to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrowser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH)\u00e2\u0080\u009d attack on web traffic protected by the TLS protocol. The general guidance to prevent this attack is to disable HTTP compression, preserving confidentiality but sacrificing bandwidth. As a more sophisticated countermeasure, fixed-dictionary compression was introduced in 2015 enabling compression while protecting high-value secrets, such as cookies, from attacks. The fixed-dictionary compression method is a cryptographically sound countermeasure against the BREACH attack, since it is proven secure in a suitable security model. In this project, we integrate the fixed-dictionary compression method as a countermeasure for BREACH attack, for real-world client-server setting. Further, we measure the performance of the fixed-dictionary compression algorithm against the DEFLATE compression algorithm. The results evident that, it is possible to save some amount of bandwidth, with reasonable compression/decompression time compared to DEFLATE operations. The countermeasure is easy to implement and deploy, hence, this would be a possible direction to mitigate the BREACH attack efficiently, rather than stripping off the HTTP compression entirely.",

However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

            "abstract": "Header compression is desirable for network applications as it saves bandwidth and reduces latency. However, when data is compressed before being encrypted, the amount of compression leaks information about the amount of redundancy in the plaintext. In web requests, headers contain secret web cookies. Therefore, compression of headers before encryption will reveal the information about the secret web cookies. This side-channel has led to Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack on web traffic protected by the SSL/TLS protocols. In order to mitigate the CRIME attack, compression is completely disabled at the TLS/SSL layer, which in return increases the bandwidth consumption and latency. In a previous work (Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2015), two countermeasures are presented with formal security proofs, against compression side-channel attacks, namely (l)-separating secret cookies from user inputs and (2)-using a static compression dictionary. In this work we create a test environment to replicate the CRIME attack and verify the attack. Moreover, we implement a proven-secure countermeasure against the CRIME attack, in a real world client/server setup, following the aforementioned two countermeasures. Our implementation achieves better compression ratio (closer to the original TLS/SSL compression), and hence reduces the bandwidth usage and latency significantly (therefore cost-effective). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proven-secure and cost-effective countermeasure implementation against the CRIME attack.",

Then, the key exchange protocol is proved with leakage resilient security model to determine whether its security proof can provide the security properties it claimed or to find out any unexamined flaw during protocol building. It is an interesting work to review the meaningful security properties provided by these security models. This work review how a leakage resilient security model for a key exchange protocol has been evolved over years according to the increasing security requirement which covers a different range of attacks. The relationship on how an adversary capability in the leakage resilient security model can be related to real-world attack scenarios is studied. The analysis work for each leakage resilient security model here enables a better knowledge on how an adversary query addresses different leakage attacks setting, thereby understand the motive of design for a cryptographic primitive in the security model.",

However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

Most of the current designs are based on simulations and artificially generated data. Therefore, the essential first step is studying and understanding the finely tuned and highly sensitive mechanism plants have developed to sense, respond, and adapt to changes in their environment, and their behavior under field and controlled systems. Therefore, this study was designed to achieve two specific objectives; to develop low-cost IoT components from basic building blocks, and to study the performance of the developed systems, and generate real-time experimental data, with and without plants. Low-cost IoT devices developed locally were used to convert existing basic polytunnels to semi-controlled and monitoring-only polytunnels. Their performances were analyzed and compared with each other based on several matrices while maintaining the planted tomato variety and agronomic practices similar. The developed system performed as expected suggesting the possibility of commercial applications and research purposes.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides.

            "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

            "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

Much work has been done in this area, yet there is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

            "abstract": "Multiprocessor systems make use of multilevel cache hierarchies to improve overall memory access speed. Embedded systems typically use configurable processors, where the caches in the system can be customized for a given application or a set of applications. Finding the optimal or a near-optimal set size, block size, and associativity of each of the caches in a multilevel cache hierarchy is a challenging task due to the presence of billions or even trillions of design points. This paper presents an iterative exploration method to find suitable configurations for all the caches in the hierarchy of an application specific multiprocessor system-on-chip, to improve memory access speed. We propose an algorithm and combine it with the use of specialized hardware for parallel cache simulation to enable multiple back-and-forth iterations through the cache levels. In every iteration, our algorithm explores selected portions of the entire design space to quickly converge upon the final design point. We demonstrate our methodology on two- and three-level cache hierarchies with private and shared caches in a quad-core system, respectively, consisting of 5.4 billion and 10.4 trillion design points. Our method was able to find design points with up to 18.9% lower average memory access time while reducing total cache size by up to 74.15%, compared to a state-of-the-art noniterative method. The number of design points explored was 4\u00c3\u0097 higher in our method, which is still a mere 3.6 \u00c3\u0097 10 -5 % of the entire design space, and took 6.08 h.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

            "abstract": "With the development of side-channel attacks, a necessity arises to invent authenticated key exchange protocols in a leakage-resilient manner. Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

Educational institutes provide the Internet access to students mainly for educational purposes. However, most of the time, students are allowed to access any content on the web. Therefore, the full bandwidth is consumed due to access to non-educational content such as streaming non-educational videos and downloading large image files, etc. Prevention of Internet usage on non-education content is practically difficult due to various reasons. Usually, this is implemented in the proxy server through maintaining a blacklist of URLs. Most of the time, this is a static list of URLs. With the fast growing content on the World Wide Web maintaining a static blacklist is impractical. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate dynamic blacklist of URLs using machine learning techniques. We experimentally investigate several machine learning algorithms to predict whether the URL in concern is educational or noneducational. The results of the initial experiments show that linear support vector machines can be used to predict the content with 98.9% accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

            "abstract": "Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) is one of the popular processor design techniques for embedded systems which allow customizability in processor design without overly hindering design flexibility. Multi-pipeline ASIPs were proposed to improve the performance of such systems by compromising between speed and processor area. One of the problems in the multi-pipeline design is the limited inherent instruction level parallelism (ILP) available in applications. The ILP of application programs can be improved via a compiler optimization technique known as loop unrolling. In this paper, we present the impact of loop unrolling on the performance (speed) of multi-pipeline ASIPs. The improvement in speed averages around 15% for a number of benchmark applications with the maximum improvement of around 30%. In addition, we report the variation of performance against the loop unrolling factor - the amount of unrolling performed on an application.",

            "abstract": "Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia (encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power. Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups, up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

            "abstract": "Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise system based, annual cricket tournament. IPL deals with millions of dollars. The amount of money spent on the IPL teams imposes high pressure on owners to search victories, which depends on team performance. Essentially, it is critical to find the right set of metrics that would lead to assemble a team with the highest chance of winning. This study attempts to identify the optimal set of attributes, which impose the high impact on the results of a cricket match. Determining an optimal set of attributes will help team owners to look for players with these attributes to form a team by which they can enhance the winnability of a cricket team. Several efforts have already been taken to address this problem without much success. Most of the existing works focused on identifying different performance metrics based on their domain knowledge of cricket. The proposed solution relies on statistical analysis and machine learning while minimizing the use of domain knowledge. Ball by ball data for all past IPL matches were collected, aggregated to innings level details for the analysis and the problem is modeled as a classification problem. The data set contained a set of features based on the innings level data and win/lose/draw class labels. Different machine learning algorithms were employed, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy in the evaluation. Then, we examined all possible feature combinations using SVM by using separate training and testing sets. Finally, the attribute set that yields the highest accuracy in the evaluation is identified, which will be the optimal set of attributes that impose the high impact on the end results of a cricket match.",

A plethora of research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism and the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease. To explore the underlying genetic structure of the disease, gene expression data is being used by many researches and computational and statistical approaches were used to identify possible genes that are risk. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework that can be used to identify possible bio-marker genes. Our experiments discover possible set of 14 genes, which some of them are validated by biological sources. We also present a critical analysis of the propose machine learning framework using GSE5281 gene dataset.",

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

The focus here is on the exploratory behavior of swarm robotics, including aggregation, dispersion, and collective movement. The system is represented as an occupancy grid problem and heuristic-based algorithms are used as optimized solutions. The decentralized approach within those methods makes them easier to idealize with current swarm robotic applications. Furthermore, these algorithms can be seamlessly integrated with other current frontier-based exploration techniques to enhance robot cooperation. All these proposed methods have been tested in different simulation environments, which mimic real world scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architectural approach that fulfils the requirement of high bandwidth and the dynamic nature of current applications. One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

            "abstract": "Using computers to answer natural language questions is an interesting and challenging problem. Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. This paper presents a system that attempts to solve close domain problems. Typically, in a close domain, answers to questions are not available in the public domain and therefore they cannot be searched using a search engine. Hence answers have to be stored in a database by a domain expert. Then, the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. We use a template matching technique to perform this matching. In addition, given that our target is to use this system with non-native English speakers, we developed a method to overcome the mismatches we might encounter due to spelling mistakes. The system is developed such that the questions can be asked using short messages from a mobile phone and therefore the system is designed to understand SMS language in addition to English. One of the main contributions of this paper is the outcome presented of a deployment of this system in a real environment.",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Metagenomics accelerated the process of studying different species and their dynamics in multiple environments. A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.",

Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU's best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs.",

            "abstract": "Huge amount of data in the form of strings are being handled in bio-computing applications and searching algorithms are quite frequently used in them. Many methods utilizing on both software and hardware are being proposed to accelerate processing of such data. The typical hardware-based acceleration techniques either require special hardware such as generalpurpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) or need building a new hardware such as an FPGA based design. On the other hard, software-based acceleration techniques are easier since they only require some changes in the software code or the software architecture. Typical software-based techniques make use of computers connected over a network, also known as a network grid to accelerate the processing. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multi-core architectures should provide better performance in this kind of computation, but still it would depend on the algorithm selected as well as the programming model being utilized. We present the acceleration of a string-searching algorithm on a multi-core CPU via a POSIX thread based implementation. Our implementation on an 8-core processor (that supports 16-threads) resulted in 9x throughput improvement compared to a single thread implementation.",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analyzing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analyzed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application, together with the hardware synthesis numbers, such as area, timing and delay. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (BioPerf, CommBench, MediaBench, MiBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analyzed for three different architectures (LEON2, PISA and ARM-Thumb). Processors are generated for these architectures for different configurations to analyze and synthesize. Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless the kind of architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process. In the paper we have measured, compared and reported the time taken for the protein inference process in our framework against a pure software implementation.",

            "abstract": "Soft error has been identified as one of the major challenges to CMOS technology based computing systems. To mitigate this problem, error recovery is a key component, which usually accounts for a substantial cost, since they must introduce redundancies in either time or space. Consequently, using state-of-art recovery techniques could heavily worsen the design constraint, which is fairly stringent for embedded system design. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW methodology that generates the processor, which performs finely configured error recovery functionality targeting the given design constraints (e.g., performance, area and power). Our methodology employs three application-specific optimization heuristics, which generate the optimized composition and configuration based on the two primitive error recovery techniques. The resultant processor is composed of selected primitive techniques at corresponding instruction execution, and configured to perform error recovery at run-time accordingly to the scheme determined at design time. The experiment results have shown that our methodology can at best achieve nine times reliability while maintaining the given constraints, in comparison to the state of the art.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

This study examines the complex nature of the disease by analyzing weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity. Through machine learning techniques, we successfully forecasted dengue outbreaks in nine districts in Sri Lanka and identified similar weather and dengue patterns in districts such as Gampaha, Colombo, Kandy and Kurunegala. These findings are important for developing an early warning system, optimizing public health measures, and efficiently allocating resources to minimize the negative impact on communities. Furthermore, the model offers valuable insights for epidemiological research on dengue spread and control.",

            "abstract": "Rijndael was standardized in 2001 by National Institute of Standard and Technology as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is still being used to encrypt financial, military and even government confidential data. In 2005, Bernstein illustrated a remote cache timing attack on AES using the client-server architecture and therefore proved a side channel in its software implementation. Over the years, a number of countermeasures have been proposed against cache timing attacks both using hardware and software. Although the software based countermeasures are flexible and easy to deploy, most of such countermeasures are vulnerable to statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel software based countermeasure against cache timing attacks, known as constant time encryption, which we believe is secure against statistical analysis. The countermeasure we proposed performs rescheduling of instructions such that the encryption rounds will consume constant time independent of the cache hits and misses. Through experiments, we prove that our countermeasure is secure against Bernstein's cache timing attack.",

            "abstract": "Present Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) manufacturers incorporate multi-millions of logic resources which enables hardware designers to design applications extending to large scales. However, handling such applications by existing FPGA Computer Aided Design (CAD) flow requires more improvement in terms of area, performance and power efficiency considerations. The current CAD flow requires the input design to be in Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL input designs limit the design productivity only to hardware experts in performing analysis for various optimisations. Optimising RTL designs manually are increasingly hard. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is an approach capable of increasing the design productivity of hardware applications compared to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and is known to be an intelligent approach for performing optimisations at a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, an approach that follows the HLS flow to cater to the mapping of FPGA applications in a power efficient manner using a communication-aware partitioning strategy is proposed. From experiments, it was possible to achieve an average reduction of 8.39% routing thermal power and 3.34% total power using the proposed approach.",

When the input data size of k-NN algorithm increases, the execution time of the algorithm increases significantly. Therefore, this becomes a bottleneck for practical usage. Since k-NN algorithm is using searching, sorting and other parallelly executable tasks, we have implemented the k-NN algorithm on a GPU using CUDA utilizing the parallel tasks. The results were promising as expected and for 43,500 training records and 14,500 testing records with nine attributes, the GPU execution showed about a 100\u00c3\u0097 faster execution time compared to a CPU version.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency in embedded systems is paramount to achieve high performance while consuming less area and power. Processors in embedded systems have to be designed carefully to achieve such design constraints. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) exploit the nature of applications to design an optimal instruction set. Despite being not general to execute any application, ASIPs are highly preferred in the embedded systems industry where the devices are produced to satisfy a certain type of application domain/s (either intra-domain or inter-domain). Typically, ASIPs are designed from a base-processor and functionalities are added for applications. This paper studies the multi-application ASIPs and their instruction sets, extensively analysing the instructions for inter-domain and intra-domain designs. Metrics analysed are the reusable instructions and the extra cost to add a certain application. A wide range of applications from various application benchmarks (MiBench, MediaBench and SPEC2006) and domains are analysed for two different architectures (ARM-Thumb and PISA). Our study shows that the intra-domain applications contain larger number of common instructions, whereas the inter-domain applications have very less common instructions, regardless of the architecture (and therefore the ISA).",

The initial design employs six Central Processing Units (CPUs) to implement a pipelined JPEG encoder, divided into stages: color space conversion, level shifting, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, Huffman encoding, and output buffering. The pipeline is then optimized using custom hardware components, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues, custom instruction blocks, and superscalar pipelines to improve performance and efficiency. The paper details the design process, various optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and the resulting performance improvements. The system is implemented and evaluated using the Cyclone IV E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform with Nios II/e processors, and the design was developed using the Quartus II software, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.",

            "abstract": "A Byzantine fault is a failure that cannot be identified by observing the output of a component; the component produces a wrong result as opposed to not producing a result at all or producing a result that can be identified as wrong. Such faults may be caused by a number of causes including software bugs and malicious attacks. Tolerating such faults is essential for a critical system. Isolated replication and majority voting is a well established technique to tolerate Byzantine faults. Current implementations of such systems either uses replicated hardware or software virtualization-using virtual machine monitors-to get the illusion of hardware replication to tolerate Byzantine faults. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using microkernel technology to achieve the isolated replication and discuss the features of a microkernel API suitable for such a deployment. The advantage of our approach is that it reduces the cost of additional hardware or avoid the complexity of virtualization required to mimic hardware replication. We used a single machine, running the L4 microkernel to provide the isolation required for the replicas. All replicas run in parallel and majority voting is performed to obtain the correct result in the presence of Byzantine faults. We selected the AES encryption algorithms for our case study and faults were deliberately injected to replicas to mimic Byzantine behavior. Our experiments show that it is feasible to use microkernels technology for this purpose.",

            "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

            "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",

When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions. We believe the suggested framework can be used in related adaptation for Web applications, desktop applications and other mobile platforms.",

Several machine learning-based studies have been conducted for miRNA identification with the use of miRNA features. It is difficult to classify real and pseudo-pre-miRNAs in plant species than that in animals since plant pre-miRNAs are more diverse than the animal pre-miRNAs. Therefore, this study is focused on classifying real and pseudo precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in plants. We have introduced a machine learning model based on a 280 feature set including compositional, sequence-based, and thermodynamic features. Classification performance is tested and compared, considering different feature sets and four different classifiers. Random forest classifier results in the best classification performance with all 280 features with a 97% accuracy for the testing dataset.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently gained traction in plant disease classification due to their strong performance in visual recognition tasks. However, their application to tomato leaf disease recognition remains challenged by two factors, namely the need for models that can generalise across diverse disease conditions and the absence of a unified framework for systematic comparison. Existing ViT-based approaches often yield inconsistent results across datasets and disease types, limiting their reliability and practical deployment. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ViT-Based Robust Framework (ViT-RoT), a novel benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the performance of various ViT architectures in tomato leaf disease classification. The framework facilitates the systematic classification of state-of-the-art ViT variants into high-, moderate-, and low-performing groups for tomato leaf disease recognition. A thorough empirical analysis is conducted using one publicly available benchmark dataset, assessed through standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that the ConvNeXt-Small and Swin-Small models consistently achieve superior accuracy and robustness across all datasets. Beyond identifying the most effective ViT variant, the study highlights critical considerations for designing ViT-based models that are not only accurate but also efficient and adaptable to real-world agricultural applications. This study contributes a structured foundation for future research and development in vision-based plant disease diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder where a person repeatedly stops breathing in sleep. Early detection is crucial for infants because it might bring long term adversities. The existing accurate detection mechanism (pulse oximetry) is a skin contact measurement. The existing non-contact mechanisms (acoustics, video processing) are not accurate enough. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer. The paper discusses the accuracy of the algorithm on real data, advantages of the new algorithm, its limitations and suggests future improvements.",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently gained traction in plant disease classification due to their strong performance in visual recognition tasks. However, their application to tomato leaf disease recognition remains challenged by two factors, namely the need for models that can generalise across diverse disease conditions and the absence of a unified framework for systematic comparison. Existing ViT-based approaches often yield inconsistent results across datasets and disease types, limiting their reliability and practical deployment. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ViT-Based Robust Framework (ViT-RoT), a novel benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the performance of various ViT architectures in tomato leaf disease classification. The framework facilitates the systematic classification of state-of-the-art ViT variants into high-, moderate-, and low-performing groups for tomato leaf disease recognition. A thorough empirical analysis is conducted using one publicly available benchmark dataset, assessed through standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that the ConvNeXt-Small and Swin-Small models consistently achieve superior accuracy and robustness across all datasets. Beyond identifying the most effective ViT variant, the study highlights critical considerations for designing ViT-based models that are not only accurate but also efficient and adaptable to real-world agricultural applications. This study contributes a structured foundation for future research and development in vision-based plant disease diagnosis.",

The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

However, they are costly, have accuracy and availability issues, and are limited only to certain types of skin tones. Our objectives were to develop a low-cost mechanism of obtaining near-infrared spectroscopy by using the image-guided technique, low-cost hardware, optimized algorithms, and evaluate its efficiency and usefulness by a clinical trial.We have tested the prototype using different combinations of light sources with different intensities and have analyzed the results. To quantitatively analyze, we have compared the number of visible veins under high intensity and low intensity. The number of visible veins is either same or up to 5 veins higher when 18W is used compared to when an intensity of 60W is used. We have also observed that the darker skin tones that have zero visible veins at normal sight result up to 2-3 veins when the prototype is used. The number of veins increased from 1 to 5, when the device was used, on fairer skin as well. We plan to conduct a clinical trial and test the device on human subjects and get feedback from the end-users, and improve the prototype accordingly.",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

This product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",

            "abstract": "The need for invigilation in any type of examination is a must to maintain academic integrity. Though e-learning systems have grown rapidly, proctors are yet to supervise a larger group of candidates through a live video stream during the examination. Often, online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost. Hence, this paper proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes by making use of inputs from a web browser, webcam video feed, and microphone audio feed, without using any external hardware or standalone application. Processing the webcam video is one of the main aspects when deciding the abnormal behavior of the candidate and features including head pose detection, eye gaze detection, liveness detection are used for predicting abnormal behaviors in this work. On the other hand, the audio stream is analyzed to detect activities such as asking for help from a person in the room. The evaluation results imply that combining several results and creating an ensemble platform produces better results.",

However, the current method does not objectively measure the player techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to objectively measure player performance on weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. We introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. In order to achieve our goal, we further introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level and introduce an automated scoring system through action recognition. We conclude our paper with qualitative and quantitative experimental results using non-Olympic players and 2016 Gold, Silver, and Bronze medalists in different weight categories (both men and women).",

            "abstract": "The static conventional network architecture is ill-suited to the growing management complexity and highly dynamic wireless network topologies. Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance. We claim that this work represents the first successful implementation results which synergizes SDN with Cognitive networks that motivates researchers towards SDN based radio resource management.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will have a pictorial idea of the sensor network. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is to develop a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then it can automatically generate all the required firmware for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is then required only to follow a few instructions to complete the real world implementation of WSNs. This paper is about developing a visual platform to design WSNs. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers. This means that if one user adds the device driver for any sensor or a microcontroller the other users can directly use it from the WSN design platform without worrying about hardware programming. Further, if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this design tool will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. The proposed method is affordable for developing custom wireless sensor networks.",

One of the key features of the SDN architecture is the separation of the control logic from data plane devices. This key feature introduces a new type of control traffic in the SDN architecture, which opens the space for new vulnerabilities to SDN-based networks. In this paper, we first present an attack model to exploit the control channel of the SDN architecture. We then experimentally evaluate the impact of the attack on the end-users of the SDN-based network using our physical experimental testbed. Our experimental results clearly show that the control channel DoS attack has a major impact on the end-users of the SDN-based networks.",

            "abstract": "Fast Internet connectivity and billions of web sites have made World Wide Web an attractive place for people to use the Internet in their day-to-day life. Educational institutes provide the Internet access to students mainly for educational purposes. However, most of the time, students are allowed to access any content on the web. Therefore, the full bandwidth is consumed due to access to non-educational content such as streaming non-educational videos and downloading large image files, etc. Prevention of Internet usage on non-education content is practically difficult due to various reasons. Usually, this is implemented in the proxy server through maintaining a blacklist of URLs. Most of the time, this is a static list of URLs. With the fast growing content on the World Wide Web maintaining a static blacklist is impractical. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate dynamic blacklist of URLs using machine learning techniques. We experimentally investigate several machine learning algorithms to predict whether the URL in concern is educational or noneducational. The results of the initial experiments show that linear support vector machines can be used to predict the content with 98.9% accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated.",

Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. Here the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. In this paper we used a template matching technique to perform this matching. The first part of the paper discusses about an automatic question answering system that we have developed using template matching techniques. The approach adopted is an automated FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) answering system that provides pre-stored answers to user questions asked in ordinary English and SMS language. The system also has techniques to overcome spelling and grammar mistakes introduced in questions by its users and therefore user-friendly compared to restricted syntax based approaches. The second part of the paper studies three techniques for performance evaluation in the above system which are based on template matching approach: 1) Random classification of templates, 2) Similarity based classification of templates, 3) Weighting template words.",

Designing such protocols in reconfigurable hardware such as FPGA has been attempted to overcome these limitations. The use of reconfigurable hardware is needed in the development phase and could eventually lead to ASICs for better performance. However, mission critical nature of such applications needs a performance guarantee on design.

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to construct several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives, including leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols and low-latency key exchange (LLKE) protocols. To this end, we introduce a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE) protocol. We introduce an appropriate security model for LR-NIKE protocols in the bounded memory leakage (BML) settings. We then show a secure construction of the LR-NIKE protocol in the BML setting that achieves an optimal leakage rate, i.e., 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 o(1). Our construction of LR-NIKE requires a minimal use of a leak-free hardware component. We argue that the use of such a leak-free hardware component seems to be unavoidable in any construction of an LR-NIKE protocol, even in the BML setting. Finally, we show how to construct the aforementioned leakage-resilient primitives from such an LR-NIKE protocol as summarized below. All these primitives also achieve the same (optimal) leakage rate as the underlying LR-NIKE protocol. We show how to construct a leakage-resilient (LR) IND-CCA-2-secure PKE scheme in the BML model generically from a bounded LR-NIKE (BLR-NIKE) protocol. Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

In most of the proposed solutions, these dynamic systems are modelled using tools like automata, Petri nets, bond graphs and Bayesian networks to diagnose and predict faults in those systems.

            "abstract": "Recently, researchers in the area of biosensor based human emotion recognition have used different types of machine learning models for recognizing human emotions. However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated.",

With the increase of the number of machines within processing plants and their operational complexities, many engineers and researchers have started looking for automated solutions for these tasks. In most of the proposed solutions, these dynamic systems are modelled using tools like automata, Petri nets, bond graphs and Bayesian networks to diagnose and predict faults in those systems.

Designing such protocols in reconfigurable hardware such as FPGA has been attempted to overcome these limitations. The use of reconfigurable hardware is needed in the development phase and could eventually lead to ASICs for better performance. However, mission critical nature of such applications needs a performance guarantee on design. This paper proposes a strategy to design formally verified reconfigurable hardware/software based implementation of network protocols in a compositional manner.",

            "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has a broad range of applications in a variety of domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.",

These attacks have become a huge threat for embedded systems, in which the security depends on the secret encryption key for the ciphers. Hence, many researchers try to find vulnerabilities of cryptosystems against power analysis attacks, so that they can develop countermeasures to ensure the security of such systems.

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has a broad range of applications in a variety of domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.",

            "abstract": "With the development of side-channel attacks, a necessity arises to invent authenticated key exchange protocols in a leakage-resilient manner. Constructing authenticated key exchange protocols using existing cryptographic schemes is an effective method, as such construction can be instantiated with any appropriate scheme in a way that the formal security argument remains valid. In parallel, constructing authenticated key exchange protocols that are proven to be secure in the standard model is more preferred as they rely on real-world assumptions. In this paper, we present a Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman-style construction of a leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange protocol, that can be instantiated with any CCLA2-secure public-key encryption scheme and a function from the pseudo-random function family. Our protocol is proven to be secure in the standard model assuming the hardness of the decisional Diffie\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hellman problem. Furthermore, it is resilient to continuous partial leakage of long-term secret keys, that happens even after the session key is established, while satisfying the security features defined by the eCK security model.",

            "abstract": "Recently, researchers in the area of biosensor based human emotion recognition have used different types of machine learning models for recognizing human emotions. However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain.",

            "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

In this paper we address the partial leakage of long-term secret keys of key exchange protocol participants due to various side-channel attacks. Security models for two-party authenticated key exchange protocols have been developed over time to provide security even when the adversary learns certain secret values. This paper combines and extends the advances of security modelling for AKE protocols addressing more granular partial leakage of long-term secrets of protocol participants. Further, we fix some flaws in security proofs of previous leakage-resilient key exchange protocols.",

The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to construct several leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives, including leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols and low-latency key exchange (LLKE) protocols. To this end, we introduce a new primitive called leakage-resilient non-interactive key exchange (LR-NIKE) protocol. We introduce an appropriate security model for LR-NIKE protocols in the bounded memory leakage (BML) settings. We then show a secure construction of the LR-NIKE protocol in the BML setting that achieves an optimal leakage rate, i.e., 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 o(1). Our construction of LR-NIKE requires a minimal use of a leak-free hardware component. We argue that the use of such a leak-free hardware component seems to be unavoidable in any construction of an LR-NIKE protocol, even in the BML setting. Finally, we show how to construct the aforementioned leakage-resilient primitives from such an LR-NIKE protocol as summarized below. All these primitives also achieve the same (optimal) leakage rate as the underlying LR-NIKE protocol. We show how to construct a leakage-resilient (LR) IND-CCA-2-secure PKE scheme in the BML model generically from a bounded LR-NIKE (BLR-NIKE) protocol. Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

            "abstract": "Recently, researchers in the area of biosensor based human emotion recognition have used different types of machine learning models for recognizing human emotions. However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain.",

Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

Designing such protocols in reconfigurable hardware such as FPGA has been attempted to overcome these limitations. The use of reconfigurable hardware is needed in the development phase and could eventually lead to ASICs for better performance. However, mission critical nature of such applications needs a performance guarantee on design.

We show how to construct a leakage-resilient (LR) IND-CCA-2-secure PKE scheme in the BML model generically from a bounded LR-NIKE (BLR-NIKE) protocol. Our construction of LR-IND-CCA-2 secure PKE differs significantly from the state-of-the-art constructions of these primitives, which mainly use hash proof techniques to achieve leakage resilience. Moreover, our transformation preserves the leakage-rate of the underlying BLR-NIKE protocol. We introduce a new leakage model for AKE protocols, in the BML setting, and present a leakage-resilient AKE protocol construction from the LR-NIKE protocol. We introduce the first-ever leakage model for LLKE protocols in the BML setting and the first construction of such a leakage-resilient LLKE from the LR-NIKE protocol.",

Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. Here the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. In this paper we used a template matching technique to perform this matching. The first part of the paper discusses about an automatic question answering system that we have developed using template matching techniques. The approach adopted is an automated FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) answering system that provides pre-stored answers to user questions asked in ordinary English and SMS language. The system also has techniques to overcome spelling and grammar mistakes introduced in questions by its users and therefore user-friendly compared to restricted syntax based approaches. The second part of the paper studies three techniques for performance evaluation in the above system which are based on template matching approach: 1) Random classification of templates, 2) Similarity based classification of templates, 3) Weighting template words.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has a broad range of applications in a variety of domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.",

In this paper we address the partial leakage of long-term secret keys of key exchange protocol participants due to various side-channel attacks. Security models for two-party authenticated key exchange protocols have been developed over time to provide security even when the adversary learns certain secret values. This paper combines and extends the advances of security modelling for AKE protocols addressing more granular partial leakage of long-term secrets of protocol participants. Further, we fix some flaws in security proofs of previous leakage-resilient key exchange protocols.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

These attacks have become a huge threat for embedded systems, in which the security depends on the secret encryption key for the ciphers. Hence, many researchers try to find vulnerabilities of cryptosystems against power analysis attacks, so that they can develop countermeasures to ensure the security of such systems. In this paper, we review some of the recent power analysis attacks on modern hardware stream ciphers such as Trivium, Grain and MICKEY.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.",

Generally such problems are handled under two categories: open domain problems and close domain problems. Here the challenge is to understand the natural language question so that the solution could be matched to the respective answer in the database. In this paper we used a template matching technique to perform this matching. The first part of the paper discusses about an automatic question answering system that we have developed using template matching techniques. The approach adopted is an automated FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) answering system that provides pre-stored answers to user questions asked in ordinary English and SMS language. The system also has techniques to overcome spelling and grammar mistakes introduced in questions by its users and therefore user-friendly compared to restricted syntax based approaches. The second part of the paper studies three techniques for performance evaluation in the above system which are based on template matching approach: 1) Random classification of templates, 2) Similarity based classification of templates, 3) Weighting template words.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.",

            "abstract": "Recently, researchers in the area of biosensor based human emotion recognition have used different types of machine learning models for recognizing human emotions. However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain.",
