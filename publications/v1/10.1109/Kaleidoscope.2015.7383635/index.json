    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an autonomic trust management framework for cloud based and highly dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. IoT is creating a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings in their day-to-day life style. Therefore, trust on IoT devices plays an important role in IoT based services and applications. Cloud computing has been changing the way how provides are looking into these issues. Many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management although non of them addresses autonomic trust management in cloud based highly dynamic IoT systems. To our understanding, IoT cloud ecosystems help to solve many of these issues while enhancing robustness and scalability. On this basis, we came up with an autonomic trust management framework based on MAPE-Kfeedback control loop to evaluate the level of trust. Finally, we presents the results that verify the effectiveness of this framework.",
