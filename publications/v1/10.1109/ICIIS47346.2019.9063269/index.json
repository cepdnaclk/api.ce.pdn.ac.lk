    "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)",
    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder where a person repeatedly stops breathing in sleep. Early detection is crucial for infants because it might bring long term adversities. The existing accurate detection mechanism (pulse oximetry) is a skin contact measurement. The existing non-contact mechanisms (acoustics, video processing) are not accurate enough. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer. The paper discusses the accuracy of the algorithm on real data, advantages of the new algorithm, its limitations and suggests future improvements.",
