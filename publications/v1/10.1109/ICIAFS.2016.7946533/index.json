    "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS)",
    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a multiple patterns searching algorithm running sequentially in various applications like network intrusion detection and bioinformatics for finding several input strings within a given large input string. The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesnt need failure links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences.",
