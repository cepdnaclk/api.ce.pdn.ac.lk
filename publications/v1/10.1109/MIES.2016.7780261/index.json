    "abstract": "Greenhouse has been the best alternative solution to get a better crop production compared to the traditional agricultural industry. Greenhouses are used to increase harvest by controlling key factors which will aect the planet growth. Real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environment and taking necessary control decisions will result in improvement of yields and economic performance. In this Research paper, we propose an environmental monitoring and controlling system that have the ability to collect the information related to greenhouse environment using various sensors. This system provides the ability to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely via a web interface and a mobile application. Using a low-cost wireless sensor network, environment data on greenhouse are sent to the centralized server. It will store all this data and show the latest environment details of the greenhouse using the web interface. The web interface will provide a real-time graphical display of data using charts and gauges and ability to send control decisions to the central node which is necessary to increase harvest and improve the quality of crops.",
