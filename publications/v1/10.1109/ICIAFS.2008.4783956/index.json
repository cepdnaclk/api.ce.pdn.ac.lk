    "venue": "2008 4th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability",

    "abstract": "Openoffice.org is a popular, free and open source office product. This product is used by millions of people and developed, maintained and extended by thousands of developers worldwide. Playing a dominant role in the Web, Web services technology is serving millions of people every day. Axis2 is one of the most popular, free and open source Web service engines. The framework presented in this paper, Axis2UNO, a combination of such two technologies is capable of making a new era in office environment. Two other attempts to enhance Web services functionality in office products are Excel Web services and UNO Web service proxy. Excel Web services is combined with Microsoft SharePoint technology and exposes information sharing in a different perspective within the proprietary Microsoft office products. UNO Web service proxy is implemented with Java Web services developer pack and enables basic Web services related functionality in Openoffice.org. However, the work presented here is the first one to combine Openoffice.org and Axis2 and we expect it to outperform the other efforts with the community involvement and feature richness in those products.",
