    "abstract": "Since the side-channel attacks arise as a huge threat for cryptographic schemes than previously realized, it is necessary to implement proven-secure leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes and use them for real-world purposes. In this work our effort is to implement two leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes, a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol, which have been proven-secure and accepted by the cryptographic community since 2011 (ASIACRYPT 2011). Our aim is to open up the direction for implementing the useful leakage-resilient cryptographic schemes for future usage.",
