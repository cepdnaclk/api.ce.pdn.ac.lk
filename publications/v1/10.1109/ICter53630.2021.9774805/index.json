    "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",
