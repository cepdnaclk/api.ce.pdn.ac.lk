    "abstract": "Cricket is a two-team outdoor game that originated in England around the 19th century. This is played in 3 forms as twenty20, ODI, and Test matches. Due to the availability of data, researchers have been able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game, and for outcome prediction. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods. Association rule mining was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we used data mining and machine learning techniques.",
